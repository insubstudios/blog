Well, I think this is looking promising.

I've got Ruby and the github-pages gem installed on my desktoper here. Got it set to `--watch` while I type up this post in [ghostwriter]. Just type up some junk, save, then hit refresh in [Firefox].

This [Smashing Mag article by Barry Clark](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) was somewhat helpful. I'm not really a fan of the "here, i did it for you." and "no, i wont tell you how to do it yourself." format. But i was able to glean from it what i needed to get going. And i'm sure this is good for the "just throw me in the pool" crowd.

And super props to Solus Forum user [sunnyflunk](https://solus-project.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=3353) for helping me get Ruby Gems going on my system.
